# Game Services

JSON files containing a list of all the games that a gaming service (including streaming ones such as Stadia) provides.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Please submit a pull request or create an issue to add / remove a game or service to the list. 

When adding a game, try to keep the name the same as ones found on [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com) as a bit of metadata is fetched from there. Please store in alphabetical order and ensure the JSON is valid.
